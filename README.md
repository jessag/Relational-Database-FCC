# Relational Database Certification
This repository includes the projects that were required to complete the Relational Database Certificate program provided by FreeCodeCamp.org.

## 1 - Celestial Bodies Database - PostgreSQL
Using PostgreSQL, this project involved creating a database of celestial bodies, such as galaxies, planets, moons, stars, and black holes, and relating these tables together to show their real-life relationships. The code was written with the VSCode editor on a virtual machine provided by FreeCodeCamp.org. The file 'universe.sql' is the result of a code dump of the database.


### Exercises
##
#### Student DB 1 
This is a code dump of a student database that was created and filled using bash scripting. Two .csv files were provided by FCC, students.csv and courses.csv. Using bash scripting, the files were parsed through line by line and student, major, and gpa information was gathered and placed in the appropriate table.
