# Relational Database Certification
This repository includes the projects that were required to complete the Relational Database Certificate program provided by FreeCodeCamp.org.

## 1 - Celestial Bodies Database - PostgreSQL
Using PostgreSQL, this project involved creating a database of celestial bodies, such as galaxies, planets, moons, stars, and black holes, and relating these tables together to show their real-life relationships. The code was written with the VSCode editor on a virtual machine provided by FreeCodeCamp.org. The file 'universe.sql' is the result of a code dump of the database.
